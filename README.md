## Overview

SoLBRF is a powerful script designed for the Solana blockchain. It employs the cluster module to create multiple worker processes. This allows for the generation of random Solana keypairs and checks if the public address corresponds to the private key. The project aims to assist developers and researchers in exploring wallet generation and balance checking.

## Features

- **Random Keypair Generation**: Quickly generates random Solana keypairs.
- **Balance Checking**: Efficiently checks wallet balances using the Solana API.
- **Multi-Process Support**: Utilizes multiple worker processes for faster execution.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for ease of use.
